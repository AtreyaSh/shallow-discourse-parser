# ideas for developments

## project structure

* 4 approaches: (old WE, old NN) as baseline, (new WE, old NN), (old WE, new NN), (new WE, new NN)

## basic tasks
* add saving ability for test_single.py
* fix minor bug in testParameterSettings_pickle.py due to unncessary re-training of word vectors
* add new files to compute accuracies for test/blind cases from best models

## word embeddings
* play with start_vectors and convert_relations to see what can be done with word vectors
* consider using some parts of the word vectors' context to influence full embedding
