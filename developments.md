# ideas for developments

## programmatic
* port all code to python3
* through this we can understand all segments

## methodologies
* add or improve segments based on understanding through porting
* possibly add some knowledge based context
* investigate new simple features that could correlate with senses, perhaps sentiment or semantic supersetting/wordnet relations
